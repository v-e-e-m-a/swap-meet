# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Veema and Olga prefer open communication so that there are no surprises. 

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We prefer working on each wave individually and then meet to merge our work.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Veema looks up things she is not sure about but relied on what ADA provides. Olga tries to problem solve using time boxing and then if she gets stuck, tries to find solutions and get actively unstuck. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Veema prefers it in writing in Slack.
Olga welcomes any feedback. 

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Veema wants to try to be more communicative and talk more about the project. Olga wants to try the same. 

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
